Replication files to the paper entitled "What explains German LÃ¤nder governments' stances towards federalism?" by Salvatore Barbaro and Julia M. Rode. 


1. Data
1.1. microdf.RData consists of all micro data associated with the assessment of states' stances. microdf.RData is a R-related file. 

1.2 LFAseit1950.csv consists of the fiscal equalisation scheme data from 1950 on. Source: Federal Ministry of Finanace, Federal Statistical Office.

2. RScripts
FactorAnalysis.R: All statistical evaluations related to states' stances. Several comments shall help to explain the steps.
BWpics.R: Generates all figures (in BW). 
Script02.R: Survey analysis for the state of BW. The script uses da data set available at gesis. The analysis relates to a section in the supplementary material.

3. Remarks
The scripts run perfectly on Linux machines. We have tested the scripts on Windows with no errors occuring.

A Data Acessibility Statement
The self conducted data as well as the Data from the Federal Statistical Office are provided. For access to gesis data refer gesis.org.

B DATASET LIST
See above (1.)

C SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
R 4.1.2 (Bird Hippie) or above. Tested on a Debian Linus OS.

D CONTROLLED RANDOMNESS
Mostly not applicable. Exemption: FactorAnalysis.R uses a bootstrap procedure with a given seed number as one robustness check.

E APPROXIMATE TIME NEEDED TO REPRODUCE THE ANALYSIS ON A STANDARD (2024) DESKTOP MACHINE
About 2 minutes (without the bootstrap part). Bootstrap: 3 min. You can speed-up the processing time when importing the gisco-data (bund_shp <- gisco_get_nuts()) with resolution = 20 instead of resolution = 03.

F DESCRIPTION OF CODE
The descriptions can be found as comment lines in the script.

INSTRUCTION FOR REPLICATORS
None.
